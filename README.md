Some Java Coding Assignments.




Problems
1.] Create a program to request integer input as an argument and check whether the input integer is a palindrome or not.

2.] Demonstrate by a JAVA program inheritance and polymorphic behavior by creating a Vehicle super class and create 2 sub classes of Vehicle class. Demonstrate both static and non-static polymorphic behavior.
a.)Demonstrate inheritance / polymorphic behavior by extending a class
b.)Demonstrate inheritance / polymorphic behavior by implementing interface

3.] Demonstrate by a JAVA program composition by creating Employee and Address class. 
Create these classes in such a way that the instances of these classes are immutable.

4.] Create a Singleton class. A Singleton class is the one whose only one instance can be created.

5.] Demonstrate by a JAVA program the usage of default / parametrized constructors, constructor overloading and constructor chaining

6.] Create an enum with below implementation
a.)The enum named StateInfo and should containing State names and 2 enum fields - capital, population. Capital - String, Population - Integer
b.)Create enum method to get population and get capital
c.)Create a reverseLookup in the enum that will allow you to send capital or population as an input and return the name of state as an output. 

7.] Solve below 2 generic programs and demonstrate the usage of them with different type arguments. 
a.)Create a generic class Box and create an attribute named item of type T in this class. Create instance methods to set / get item from the box. The return of get method and the argument of set method must be a type parameter.
b.)Create an interface named Pair<K,V> with two methods getKey() with return as type parameter K and method getValue() with return as type parameter V
c.)Create an OrderedPair<K, V> that implements Pair<K,V> and provides the actual values in K and V by getKey and getValue method.

8.] Solve below Exception Handling problems
a.)Create a custom checked exception and demonstrate the usage of thows keyword and try-catch block with custom checked exception
b.)Create a custom unchecked exception and demonstrate the usage of thows keyword and try-catch block with custom unchecked exception
c.)Demonstrate the java 7 feature of "try with resources"

9.] Demonstrate behavior parametrization using anonymous classes. 
a.)Create Printable interface with method print
b.)Create 2 classes, Document and Image with display method and display method accepting Printable as an argument
c.)Call display method on the instance of Document and Image by supporting different implementation to the Printable interface.
d.)Demonstrate use of Anonymous classes

10.] Demonstrate the use of switch case with
a.)int
b.)String
c.)Enum

11.]Read a file containing a paragraph and provide a count of each word (case sensitive) i the file. Ignore white spaces. 
Try to make use of collections

12.]Accept an input from the user as the absolute directory name and provide count of eacah and every folder and file from the input directory.
Please note that folders may have other folders inside.
